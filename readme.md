# Loan Approval System

The Loan Approval System is a project that demonstrates complex business logic by simulating a loan approval process. The system evaluates loan applications based on various criteria and applies predefined rules and algorithms to make approval decisions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- `LoanApplication`: Represents a loan application with properties like applicant name, credit score, income, and loan amount.
- `LoanApprovalService`: Contains the business logic for evaluating loan applications and making approval decisions based on predefined rules.
- `Rule`: Interface defining a contract for loan approval rules.
- `CreditScoreRule`: Implements the Rule interface to evaluate the credit score of the loan applicant.
- `IncomeRule`: Implements the Rule interface to evaluate the income of the loan applicant.
- `LoanAmountRule`: Implements the Rule interface to evaluate the loan amount requested.
- `ApprovalDecision`: Enum representing the decision made for a loan application (Approved, Rejected, or Pending).

## Getting Started

To run the loan approval system project:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open the project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

3. Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the code.

4. Navigate to the `Program.cs` file and modify the sample loan application data if desired.

5. Run the application.

## Customizing the Loan Approval System

You can customize and extend the loan approval system based on your specific business logic requirements. Here are some possible modifications:

- Add more rules: Implement additional rule classes to evaluate other aspects of loan applications, such as employment history or debt-to-income ratio.

- Modify rule logic: Adjust the evaluation logic in existing rule classes to reflect your specific criteria for loan approval.

- Expand data model: Extend the `LoanApplication` class with additional properties or introduce new classes to capture more information relevant to the loan approval process.

- Implement complex algorithms: Develop more sophisticated algorithms for evaluating loan applications, considering multiple factors and introducing weighted scoring systems.
